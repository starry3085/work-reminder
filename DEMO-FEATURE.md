# Demo Feature Implementation

## Overview
The Demo feature provides an interactive demonstration of the reminder functionality with accelerated timing (30 seconds instead of 30 minutes) to showcase the application's core value proposition.

## Features
- **Quick Demonstration**: 30-second intervals for immediate user feedback
- **Automated Sequence**: Water reminder starts first, Standup reminder starts 10 seconds later
- **Clear Labeling**: "FOR DEMO PURPOSE" messaging to set proper expectations
- **Auto-cleanup**: Automatically restores normal state after demo completion
- **Non-intrusive**: Does not interfere with normal application functionality

## User Experience
1. User clicks the "Demo" button in the header
2. System displays "Demo starting..." status
3. Water reminder automatically starts with 30-second countdown
4. After 10 seconds, Standup reminder automatically starts
5. User sees both browser notifications appear sequentially
6. Demo automatically ends and restores normal 30-minute intervals

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `js/constants.js` - Added DEMO_CONSTANTS configuration
- `js/demo-controller.js` - New demo orchestration class
- `js/app.js` - Integrated DemoController into main application
- `js/ui-controller.js` - Added demo button handling
- `index.html` - Added demo button and status display
- `styles/main.css` - Added demo-specific styling

### Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Demo logic isolated in dedicated controller
- **State Management**: Proper state backup and restoration
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if demo fails
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of timers and event listeners

### Configuration
```javascript
const DEMO_CONSTANTS = {
    WATER_START_DELAY_MS: 0,        // Start water reminder immediately
    STANDUP_START_DELAY_MS: 10000,  // Start standup reminder after 10 seconds
    STATUS_MESSAGES: {
        READY: 'Click Demo to see how reminders work',
        STARTING: 'Demo starting...',
        WATER_STARTING: 'Starting water reminder (FOR DEMO PURPOSE - 30s interval)',
        STANDUP_STARTING: 'Starting standup reminder (FOR DEMO PURPOSE - 30s interval)',
        RUNNING: 'Demo running - watch for notifications!',
        COMPLETED: 'Demo completed - reminders reset to normal'
    }
};
```

## Testing
1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Ensure notification permissions are granted
3. Click the "Demo" button
4. Observe the status messages and countdown timers
5. Watch for browser notifications at 30s and 40s marks
6. Verify automatic cleanup and state restoration

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with Web Notifications API support
- Graceful degradation for browsers without notification support
- Mobile-responsive design for touch devices

## Performance
- Minimal memory footprint
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- No impact on normal application performance
- Efficient timer management

## Future Enhancements
- Visual notification preview for browsers with blocked notifications
- Demo progress indicator
- Customizable demo timing
- Multi-language support for demo messages
