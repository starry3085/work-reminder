# Deployment Checklist

This document provides complete steps and verification process for deploying the Office Wellness Reminder application to GitHub Pages.

## Pre-deployment Checks

- [ ] All functionality tests passed
- [ ] Responsive design tested on different devices
- [ ] All resource files (images, audio, etc.) included in project
- [ ] All JavaScript and CSS files compressed (optional)
- [ ] Ensure favicon.ico and other icon files exist
- [ ] Ensure manifest.json file is correctly configured
- [ ] Ensure Service Worker is correctly implemented
- [ ] Documentation updated and synchronized through automated system

## Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare GitHub Repository**
   - [ ] Create new GitHub repository or use existing repository
   - [ ] Ensure repository is public (for GitHub free accounts)

2. **Push Code**
   - [ ] Push all code to main branch of GitHub repository (usually `main` or `master`)
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Configure GitHub Pages**
   - [ ] Go to repository settings -> Pages
   - [ ] Select deployment source as `gh-pages` branch
   - [ ] Click save

4. **Trigger Automatic Deployment**
   - [ ] Pushing code to main branch will automatically trigger GitHub Actions workflow
   - [ ] Wait for deployment completion (usually takes 1-2 minutes)
   - [ ] Check deployment status in repository's Actions tab

## Post-deployment Verification

1. **Access Deployed Website**
   - [ ] Visit `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`
   - [ ] Ensure page loads normally

2. **Run Deployment Verification**
   - [ ] Add `?verify=true` parameter to URL
   - [ ] Check if all verification results pass

3. **Functionality Verification**
   - [ ] Test water reminder functionality
   - [ ] Test standup reminder functionality
   - [ ] Test settings save functionality
   - [ ] Test notification functionality
   - [ ] Test responsive design (view on mobile devices)

4. **Compatibility Check**
   - [ ] Test in Chrome browser
   - [ ] Test in Firefox browser
   - [ ] Test in Safari browser
   - [ ] Test in Edge browser
   - [ ] Test in mobile device browsers

## Common Issue Troubleshooting

### Page Cannot Be Accessed
- Check if GitHub Pages configuration in repository settings is correct
- Confirm deployment completed successfully
- Check if URL is correct (pay attention to case sensitivity)

### Resource Files Cannot Load
- Check if resource file paths are correct
- Ensure all resource files have been pushed to repository
- Check browser console for 404 errors

### JavaScript Errors
- Check browser console for error messages
- Ensure all dependent JavaScript files are loaded correctly
- Verify Service Worker registration is successful

### Local Storage Issues
- Ensure browser supports and has localStorage enabled
- Check if there is sufficient storage space
- Verify storage operations have no errors

## Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

If you need to use a custom domain, follow these steps:

1. Add CNAME record at DNS provider, pointing to `<username>.github.io`
2. Add CNAME file in repository root directory with custom domain as content
3. Fill in custom domain in Pages section of GitHub repository settings
4. Check "Enforce HTTPS" option (if available)
