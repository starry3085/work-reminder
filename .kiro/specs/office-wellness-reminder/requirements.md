# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Office Wellness Reminder System is a pure frontend web application designed to help office workers who spend long hours at computers develop healthy work habits. The system provides timed water reminders and anti-sedentary reminders through a friendly interface and customizable reminder settings, helping users maintain physical health during work. The application will be deployed on GitHub Pages, requiring no backend server and running entirely in the browser.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 - Water Reminder Functionality

**User Story:** As an office worker, I want to be able to set timed water reminders so that I don't forget to stay hydrated while focused on work, maintaining my physical health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. When the user first visits the application, the system should display water reminder setting options
2. When the user sets water reminder interval time, the system should save this setting to local storage
3. When the set reminder time is reached, the system should display a water reminder notification
4. When the reminder time is reached, the system should display a notification that automatically disappears after 5 seconds and then reset the timer
5. When the user pauses the water reminder, the system should stop timing and save the state
6. If the user closes the browser tab, the system should restore the reminder state when reopened

### Requirement 2 - Anti-Sedentary Reminder Functionality

**User Story:** As an office worker who needs to sit for long periods, I want to be able to set timed stand-up activity reminders so that I can avoid the health hazards of prolonged sitting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. When the user sets sedentary reminder interval time, the system should save this setting to local storage
2. When the set sedentary reminder time is reached, the system should display a stand-up activity reminder notification
3. When the sedentary reminder time is reached, the system should display a notification that automatically disappears after 5 seconds and then reset the timer
4. When the user pauses the sedentary reminder, the system should stop timing and save the state
5. When the user has mouse or keyboard activity within the set time, the system should automatically extend the sedentary timing
6. If the user leaves the computer for more than 5 minutes, the system should pause the sedentary timing

### Requirement 3 - User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application interface to be simple, friendly, and easy to use so that I can quickly set up and manage my health reminders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. When the user visits the application, the system should display a clear main interface including current status and setting options
2. When the user needs to adjust settings, the system should provide an intuitive settings panel
3. When reminders are triggered, the system should display non-intrusive notifications that don't interfere with the user's current work
4. When the user accesses on mobile devices, the system should provide responsive design adapted to different screen sizes
5. If the browser supports notification API, the system should request permission and send browser notifications
6. When the user uses it for the first time, the system should display simple usage guidance

### Requirement 4 - Data Persistence and Settings Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my settings and usage data to be saved so that I don't need to reconfigure every time I open the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. When the user modifies any settings, the system should immediately save to browser local storage
2. When the user reopens the application, the system should automatically load previously saved settings
3. When the user clears browser data, the system should gracefully handle data loss situations
4. When the user wants to reset all settings, the system should provide a reset option
5. If local storage is unavailable, the system should use default settings and notify the user

### Requirement 5 - Deployment and Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to access this application in any modern browser and have it run stably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. When the application is deployed to GitHub Pages, the system should be accessible and run normally
2. When the user uses mainstream browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, the system should work normally
3. When the user accesses from different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux), the system should maintain consistent functionality
4. When network connection is unstable, the system should be able to run offline (since it's a pure frontend application)
5. If the user uses older browsers, the system should provide basic functionality or friendly unsupported notifications
